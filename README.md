# Experimental Setup for Convolution Neural Networks

## Available techniques are as follows

* Images.txt file contains information how to manuplate an image and apply transformations along with passing through conv layers.

* Able to run experiments on a specific architecture with the provided datasets.

Also, In this time, the model will make sure the output stays the  same throughtout the process.
